# Vertebral Age Estimation

This repository contains the code and resources for the study titled:

**"Can lumbar vertebral body CT density reflect age?"**

## 📌 Description
This project investigates the relationship between vertebral bone density and chronological age using CT imaging. It includes machine learning models such as Random Forest regression and logistic regression to estimate or classify age based on Hounsfield Unit (HU) values.

## 🧪 Methods
- **Data Source:** Retrospective lumbar CT scans (2024–2025)
- **Measurement Site:** Axial midpoint of the L3 vertebral body
- **Models Used:**
  - Pearson correlation
  - Piecewise linear regression (breakpoint analysis)
  - Random Forest regression
  - Logistic regression

## 📁 Repository Contents
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for model training and evaluation

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.11
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- scipy
